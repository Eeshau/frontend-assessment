# Simplify Frontend Exercise

Hello! If you're reading this then we're likely in the process of considering you for a role at Simplify. If so, congratulations ðŸŽ‰ !

We'd like to know a little more about how you work, so this repository contains a short (approximately 2-3 hours) exercise that you can use demonstrate your skills and abilities.

We know that 2-3 hours is not a lot of time and you may not be able to complete everything you'd like, and will feel pressure to do more. We're not looking for perfection in the UI and are not evaluating your skills as a designer so be sure to focus on functionality and showing your knowledge of NextJS and React best practices. Best of luck!

# Overview

In this exercise you will be using React, NextJS, and TailwindCSS to make three pages of an ecommerce app. You will be getting familiar with TailwindCSS and exploring the features of NextJS like server-side rendering, app layouts, and dynamic slugs. Your task will be to create pages/components based on the designs from a Figma file, mock an api to provide data to the pages, and follow instructions on which NextJS features to use for the pages.

The goal of this exercise is to evaulate your ability to:
* translate specs into well organized components
* successfully implement advanced features of NextJS you may be unfamiliar with
* showcase your experience with styling components with TailwindCSS

# Instructions

Fork this repo to get started. We've provided a starter project for you with React 18, Typescript, (NextJS 13)[https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/getting-started], (TailwindCSS)[https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation], and (SWR)[https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started] already added and default configured. Be sure to read through the docs for these libraries if you are unfamiliar. You're also welcome to use any other packages if you'd like, just be sure to explain why you decided to use them and meet all the project requirements with the provided stack.

1. Mock ecommerce API

Using the api route feature in mock a route for getting a list of favorite items and a route for getting details of an item from its ID. We've provided a json file with mock data to use called 'data.json'. Feel free to modify it or add to it if you wish.

2. Make three pages using NextJS App Router format.

The designs for the three pages can be found in this (Figma file)[https://www.figma.com/file/lUbwgHr7OTh4IEf1Y4szwf/NextJS-Ecommerce?node-id=0%3A1&t=bHXi1DmZpSYk17Wd-1]. 

* /dashboard/list
* /dashboard/card
* /item/[id]
