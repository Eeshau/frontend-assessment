# Simplify Frontend Exercise

Hello! If you are reading this then we're likely in the process of considerign you for a role at Simplify. If so, congratulations ðŸŽ‰ !

We'd like to know a little more about how you work, so this repository contains a short (approximately 2-3 hours) exercise that you can use demonstrate your skills and abilities.

We know that 2-3 hours is not a lot of time and you will both not be able to complete everything you'd like, and will feel pressure to do more. We are not looking for perfection in the UI and are not evaluating your skills as a designer so be sure to focus on functionality and showing your knowledge of NextJS and React best practices. Best of luck!

# Overview

In this exercise you will be using React, NextJS, and TailwindCSS to make three pages of an ecommerce app. You will be getting familiar with TailwindCSS and exploring the features of NextJS like server-side rendering, app layouts, and dynamic slugs. Your task will be to create pages/components based on the designs from a Figma file, mock an api to provide data to the pages, and follow instructions on which NextJS features to use for the pages.

The goal of this exercise is to evaulate your ability to:
* translate specs into well organized components
* successfully implement advanced features of NextJS you may be unfamiliar with
* showcase your experience with styling components with TailwindCSS
